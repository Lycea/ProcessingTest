This is a repo for my future web page

for now it is a work in progress
but already shows two kind of "posts"

also it started as a test for integrating processing to files

Later there will be a kind of template engine
like from jekyll all based of some python 
scripts that parse a simple markdown
syntax and put together all the pages
as they are needed.
