This is a repo for my future web page

for now it is a work in progress
but already shows two kind of "posts"

There is also a base layout available for now.
In future time all that is there at the moment will be
generated by a complex script from some templates.



### Available scripts

#### Sketch creator

There is a file which when executed whith a name
will create a whole directory ready to start
in the sketches directory. It can be found (here)[scripts/].

#### Parser

there is the start of a md file parser here also
you can find it  [here](scripts/md_parser)
The parser will most likely be seperated into three parts which all
hava an own folder.

+ (tokenizer)[scripts/md_parser/tokenizer] (available and working)
+ (parser)[scripts/md_parser/parser]       (not yet there)
+ (generator)[scripts/md_parser/generator] (not yet there)
