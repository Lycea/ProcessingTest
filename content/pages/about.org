This page is work in progress
So please don't expect to much for now

And about me I'm an engineer trying to build up this page and fill it with
interesting pages about what I have found out while programming or using
sofware.

Here are some of the examples what it could be about !
- Programming
  - Love2d / lua
  - Processing / p5js
  - Python
  - rust
  - list / emacs
- Projets
- Tutorials
- Digital art ?

and whatever I feel like discussing about or sharing my new won insight !
