P5.js is a small js library which wraps around
the canvas and is easily used to create a simple
little generative sketch all by itself, but what if
you want to include it into another web page, how should you do that ?
That is what I want to elaborate here further.

*** Link to the page directly

Here you can see one of my first sketches for example on a seperate link:

[[../../sketches/rectangles_1/rectangles_1.html]]

That works fine you will end up there without problem but it is a new
page and disturbs the flow of the post.

So what else can we do than?


*** Insert a video about the things you want to show
One idea would be simply create a video of the things that you want to show:

TODO insert a video here.

That is nice and everything and woll definitely work for a lot of things
but for my case I have interacive pages or sketches which will run endless
so that does not fit to what I potentially want to show with it but at least
a video will not distrube the reader to somewhere else.





*** Insert the sketch directly

The other way is to include the sketch itself into the page.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <object data="../../sketches/snow_flakes/snow_flakes.html" type="text/html" width="50px" style="overflow:hidden; min-width: 101%; min-height: 101%"></object>
#+END_EXPORT
